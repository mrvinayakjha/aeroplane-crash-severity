Aeroplane Crash Severity: Predictions using ML techniques

Aircraft accidents are among the most perilous and catastrophic incidents in transportation history. From the first recorded aviation disaster involving a balloon in France on June 15, 1785, to the tragic incidents involving powered aircraft like the Wright Model A constructed by the Wright Brothers, the aviation industry has faced a series of challenges and tragedies.

However, since 1980, there has been a notable decline in the frequency of aviation accidents. This downward trend suggests a growing understanding of the factors contributing to airplane crashes and an improvement in aviation safety measures.

This article explores a case study based on data from airline accidents, highlighting the progress and lessons learned from past incidents to enhance aviation safety further.
